Unofficial repository for [EeveeSpotify](https://github.com/whoeevee/EeveeSpotifyReborn) and [EeveeSpotifyRevived](https://github.com/Meeep1/EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic) releases. ~~Automatically fetched from the official [Telegram channel](https://t.me/SpotilifeIPAs).~~ Automatic updates of IPA packages via Telegram are temporarily disabled due to the discontinuation of the original project. I will manually add the new versions to the repo for now.<br>

**AltStore**, **SideStore**, **Feather**, **LiveContainer** are supported<br>

All content in this repository is cloned to [GitHub](https://github.com/titouan336/Spotify-AltStoreRepo-mirror), except for IPAs files, which are hosted exclusively on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/titouan336/Spotify-AltStoreRepo).<br>

### January, 04, 2026 update :
On December 26, 2025, eevee announced that the project was officially discontinued via a message on his [Telegram channel](https://t.me/SpotilifeIPAs/196), On december 28, the GitHub repo was archived in read-only.
The project was continued by [Skye/Meeep1](https://github.com/Meeep1) under the fork [EeveeSpotifyRevived](https://github.com/Meeep1/EeveeSpotifyRevivedPublic) but does not currently support custom lyrics. (Musixmatch, ect.)<br>
<br>For now, the IPA files for both projects are available for download on this AltStore repo but are separated to give users a choice. The applications will be merged when the new fork is perfected and supports custom lyrics.<br>

## EeveeSpotify
This tweak makes Spotify think you have a Premium subscription, granting free listening, just like Spotilife, and provides some additional features like custom lyrics.
